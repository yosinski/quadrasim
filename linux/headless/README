Installation for the simulator in Windows:
Use the standalone file.



Installation for the simulator in Linux:

First download the Nvidia PhysX engine for Linux.
This website instructs how to install PhysX in linux (PhysX is primarily supported on Windows): http://about.something.pl/art/howto-setup-physx-sdk-in-linux.html

You must also install and link the necessary boost libraries, Nvidia Cg Toolkit, dynamixel libraries, jpeg-8d libraries, and (maybe) galib247 library. I have uploaded all these in:


Then in shell, use the command
 $make clean all
to compile the simulator

To use the simulator place the data/ directory which contains the robot information inside the simulator directory, then use the command
 $./name_of_simulator 
to open the simulator.

To input a gait, use the command
 $./name_of_simulator -i gait_file_name

To input a gait and specify the name of the output the results of that gaitfile, use the command
 $./name_of_simulator -i gait_file_name -o output_file_name


To record a video of the gaits (non-headless simulator), you can press TAB, which will generate photos of the gait, which you could put together as a video using ffmpeg or virtualdubmod.
