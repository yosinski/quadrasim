QuadraTot simulator

----------------------------

evolution.exe - starts an evolutionary run

keys:
F1 - toggle visualization, speeds up evolution especially if you have a slow GPU
F4 - toggle 60Hz frame rate lock, this is "real" time.
F5 - "orbit" cam (default). mouse pos - orbiting, mouse wheel - zoom
F6 - follow cam. can be combined with pressing mouse button for orbit mode
F7 - free cam. arrow keys - turn, awdx - translate, ec - up/down

lctrl - hold down for debug visualization - shows shapes and joint etc.

eye candy:
F11 - toggle polygon mesh display (does not affect the simulation)
"'" - glow
"." - noise
"-" - image overlay


----------------------------

test.exe - starts "test" mode where you can test the robot. also accepts command line arguments:

command line arguments: [-i InputFile -o OutputFile -n -l]
        n: No GUI
        l: loop playback of control file
        InputFile: Control file name  (try the cmd_*.txt files)
        OutputFile: Output log file name
		
keys (in addition to the ones from above):
F3 - toggle animation
F12 - freeze simulation (but not camera)

u - load quadratot robot
lctrl + u load robot with log_bestind.txt which is the current best result from evolution
ralt + u load robot with cmd_fixed_positons.txt and plays back position keys with linear interpolation
