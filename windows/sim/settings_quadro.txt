# sample settings for GAlib applications

# GAlib expects parameters in name-value pairs.  The name should be a single
# string (no whitespace allowed).  The value should be of a type appropriate
# for the named parameter.  Anything after a # character will be ignored.
# The file must end with a blank line.  If you specify parameters that depend
# on other parameters, the last parameter will override the first or act on
# data modified by the first (the parameters are applied in the order they 
# are listed).
